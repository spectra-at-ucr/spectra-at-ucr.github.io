Welcome to the site for Spectra at UCR! We are in the process of founing a student chapter of the organization [Spectra](lgbtqmath.org) at the [University of California, Riverside](https://mathdept.ucr.edu/).

Currently, we are drafting our bylaws as a community. Then we will hold elections to estabilish our first officer team and apply for creating the chapter. Stay tuned!
