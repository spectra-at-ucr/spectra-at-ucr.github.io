# Possible Activities
At the first General Meeting of Spring 2025, we discussed some different possible activities that we could do this quarter.

Here are the highlights:
- Start a reading group. If people are interested, Corryn has a book on Queer Theory in mind. Fill out an interest form [here](https://forms.gle/tbGtdTFhTqyYcMgu7)
- Student-led talks. These can be about mathematics, being queer, or some (non-)linear comibination of the two. If you'd like to give a talk, fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/HkaWyVRNZqvjfVYB9)
- Some sort of off-campus excursion could be a possibility. This could be anything from like a hike, going bowling, or visiting somewhere like a museum or restaraunt.
- An end-of-the-year lunch/dinner. This will likely be a potluck. Our treasurer, Luis, will be in charge of organizing this.
- Board Games! Chris has volunteered to organize another board game day, so stay tuned for an email from them.
- Presentation night. One member (outside of our meeting), Michael, suggested a night where a bunch of people just prepare short presentations on whatever they want and we all get together and present them.
- If you'd like to see anything in particular, feel free to tag me in the meeting-suggestions channel on our Discord!
