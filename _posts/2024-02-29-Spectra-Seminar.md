## Speaker: 
Luis Palacios Vela (University of California, Riverside)

## Title:
The n-sphere: spikiness, slimness, and curse of dimension.

## Abstract:
I'm this talk I would like to give some intuition about the n-th dimensional sphere. Some constructions that show the spikiness, the formula for the generalized volume, and how this relates to the curse of dimension.
