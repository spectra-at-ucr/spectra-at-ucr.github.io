Agenda:
- Introduction and Overview
- Officers
- Bylaws
- Chapter Goals & Discussion

During the discussion of officer roles, there was a suggestion to found a “funding committee”, which would be in contact with the HUB, Spectra, and would possibly collect dues, in order to collect and manage our money. This committee would work closely with the treasurer.

It was brought up that we shouldn’t have an officer election before discussing bylaws, so we left the election until next meeting. The plan is to have a google form for nominations, as well as an editable draft of the bylaws so members can help shape the written goals of the group. (post-meeting note: Both of these have been set up)

While discussing the bylaws, there was a suggestion that the purpose and membership sections should place a statement about queer identity closer to the beginning of each section. 

Some suggested activities the group can engage in include:
- 3x meetings per quarter
- Monthly officer meetings
- A lecture series about the research and lived experience of queer mathematicians
  - (either with invited speakers or given by members or both)
  - (we can also ask speakers here for other reasons, for instance invited to speak in another seminar, to give a bonus talk at Spectra)
- Mentorship opportunities
  - In a sporadic “office hours” setting where people can show up and ask questions about math or queer issues or both of some more experienced member
  - In an structured “big/little” setting where people have assigned mentors to help them consistently throughout a longer time period
- A meet-up at the JMM
- Connections with other queer events and organizations at UCR and in Riverside more broadly
- Informal food events, game nights, etc.
- Designated lunch time at the HUB, etc. where anyone who’s free can meet up and get food together and talk
- Specific mentorship about, eg, trans healthcare.
- Set up a spectra discord/mailing list/etc
- Organization advertising 
  - (working with LGBT-RC, tabling, etc.)
  - Emailing the CS/engineering/CNAS student dlists who might also be interested in joining
