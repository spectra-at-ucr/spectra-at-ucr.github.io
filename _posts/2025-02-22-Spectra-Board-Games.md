## Spectra Board Game Lunch!

Hi all, this is post is coming to you from Mark. I think I'm the secretary (and possibly also the vice president? It's been a long time since we here at Spectra at UCR have talked about anything regarding our organization).

Anyways, with that out of the way, our good friend Chris Grossack is hosting a board game lunch on Thursday, March 6, 2025 in Skye 347. They've booked the room from 11 AM - 1 PM, but will be in their office afterwards.

Feel free to bring food, snacks, and board games if you're able to come!
